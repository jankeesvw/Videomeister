# Videomeister

I got a lot of requests for a working example for my subtitle parser (http://blog.base42.nl/2009/07/29/as3-srt-subtitle-parser/). This project contains all the code needed to add subtitle to your own videoplayer.

I used these external libraries to build this:

- Minimalcomps (for slider)
- Logmeister (for logging)
- Pyro (for the videoplayer)
- Greensock (for LoaderMax)
